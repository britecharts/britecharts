# Britecharts

[![Britecharts Logo][36]][31]

> Britecharts is a client-side **reusable Charting Library** based on [D3.js v4][1] that allows easy and intuitive use of charts and components that can be composed together creating amazing visualizations.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eventbrite/britecharts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eventbrite/britecharts)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/britecharts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/britecharts)
[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/britecharts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/bo/britecharts)

Britecharts [components][32] have been written in ES2015 with a Test Driven methodology so they are **fully tested**, and we are commited to keeping them that way.

## Key Features

The main characteristics of this library are:

- Reusability
- Composability
- Fully tested
- ES2015 source code (transpiled with [Babel][17])

## Usage

The typical use of Britecharts involves creating a chart using its simple API, then rendering it on a container which has previously had data applied to it. The code will look like this:

    barChart
        .width(500)
        .height(300);

    barContainer.datum(dataset).call(barChart);

## API

All the components expose some basic API methods like width, height and margin. Additionally, each chart or component can expose more methods. Those can be found in the documentation of the modules:

 - Line Chart: [API][25] - [Demo][5]
 - Donut Chart: [API][21] - [Demo][6]
 - Bar Chart: [API][22] - [Demo][4]
 - Stacked Bar Chart: [API][38] - [Demo][39]
 - Grouped Bar Chart: [API][40] - [Demo][41]
 - Brush Chart: [API][23] - [Demo][18]
 - Sparkline Chart: [API][29] - [Demo][7]
 - Stacked Area Chart: [API][30] - [Demo][8]
 - Tooltip Chart: [API][27] - [Demo][5]
 - Mini Tooltip Chart: [API][26] - [Demo][4]
 - Legend Chart: [API][24] - [Demo][6]
 - Step Chart: [API][28] - [Demo][11]

## Installation

Britecharts components are distributed in **UMD modules**, each one exposing a D3.js component written with the [Reusable API pattern][3]. In order to use any of the Britecharts modules, you will need to require the chart in your JS file using AMD/CommonJS modules or adding a script tag with the `src` pointing to the file. You would also need to load the [D3.js selection][37] library in order to select the chart container.

```
   npm install britecharts d3-selection
```

They also provide some minimal CSS styling, that can be loaded independently or as a bundle. Check out our [CDN demo][cdnDemo] page or our [JSBin][jsbinSandbox] and [CodePen][codepenSandbox] sandbox projects. You can also watch [Per Borgen's screencast][screenCast] to see Britecharts in action.

## Acknowledgments

Britecharts was inspired by two books, [Developing a D3.js Edge][19] and [Mastering D3.js][20]. It also leveraged a great number of examples and articles from the [D3.js][1] community overall.
