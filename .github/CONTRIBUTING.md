## Reporting an Issue
The easiest way you can contribute to Britecharts is by creating issues. For that, please use the [issues][issues] section of the Britecharts repository and search for a similar problem. If you don't find it, submit your bug, question, proposal or feature request. If you don't find it, submit your bug, question, proposal or feature request. They will remain closed until sufficient interest, e.g. üëç reactions, has been shown by the community.

In the case of bugs, please be descriptive and, if possible, include a Codepen with the issue happening or add a screenshot of the issue. You can use [this Codepen bug template](https://codepen.io/Britecharts/pen/PRyZNy?editors=1010#0) as a jumping off point.


## Creating Pull Requests
Before sending a Pull Request with significant changes, please use the [issue tracker][issues] to discuss the potential improvements you want to make.

We always have tickets labeled 'help wanted' or 'good first issue.' They are a great starting point if you want to contribute. Don't hesitate to ask questions about the issue if you are not sure about the strategy to follow.

You may also take on any issues that don't currently have an assignee and we labeled as 'ready to go.'

## Setup
To start contributing to Britecharts, you need to set up your machine to develop with the library. Read on to learn how to set up your fork, create branches and run the project in your machine.

### Getting Set Up to Contribute
1. Fork the Britecharts repository by clicking the fork button on Github
2. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/<your handle>/britecharts.git`
3. Navigate to the repository folder and install dependencies with: `yarn` (we are using node 12.2.0 at the moment)
4. If you don't have yarn installed, you can install it following the instructions in the [yarn docs][yarn]
5. Make sure you have Chrome installed, and your `CHROME_BIN` environment variable is set.

### Creating Feature and Fix Branches
1. In local master, set the upstream to https://github.com/britecharts/britecharts.git
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/britecharts/britecharts.git`
2. Pull the most recent changes with `git pull --rebase upstream master`
3. Create a new branch. Branch names should be prefixed with either `fix-`, `feat-` or `ref-` depending on your PR content. Run `git checkout -b [fix|feat|ref]-<your branch name>`

### Running the Demos
To generate the demos you need to:

1. Download and install node
1. Ensure you have [yarn][yarn] installed as well
1. Clone the repository with:
    `git clone git@github.com:britecharts/britecharts.git`
1. Change directory into the repository root (or head to the specific package in the `packages/` folder) and install its dependencies with yarn:
    `yarn`
1. In the root or the repository (or package) folder, run:
    `yarn start`
1. In the root or the repository (or package) folder, run:
    `yarn run test:watch`

This process generates the demos and opens their Storybook interface in a new browser tab. There you can navigate the Demo of each chart and see some examples. We recommend you to use these demos as your testing platform when modifying the charts.

### Running the Documentation
To generate the documentation you need to:

1. Download and install node
1. Ensure you have [yarn][yarn] installed as well
1. Clone the repository with:
    `git clone git@github.com:britecharts/britecharts.git`
1. Change directory into the repository root and install its dependencies with yarn:
    `yarn`
1. In the root or the repository folder, run:
    `yarn run docs`

This process generates the documentation from the packages' Readme files, their code and the material in the `@britecharts/docs` package. It also opens the website in a new browser tab.

## Next Steps
Once you have your environment set and ready to go, you can check our [Contributor How To Guides][contributorHowTo] to learn how to create a Pull Request, Modify or Create a chart.
