# Britecharts Roadmap

## Project Mission
Britecharts is a charting library based on D3.js that allows easy and intuitive use of charts and components that can be composed together, creating amazing visualizations.

The idea behind Britecharts is two-fold:
- We want to allow developers and designers with little experience on D3.js to build great interactive charts with little initial effort.
- We want to propose a framework for helping D3.js developers to create new D3.js charts by following standards like the Reusable API and Test Driven Development.

Britecharts is an implementation of the Reusable API. It solves the problems of regular D3.js charts, namely: lack of modularity, high complexity, low re-usability, and null test-ability.

## How to Get Involved
If you are excited about Britecharts, want to add more configurable properties or even create your own chart, please check our [Contributing Guide][contribute]. In it, we walk you through the development environment setup, running our docs and demos and creating new Pull Requests.
